### A Nighttime Theme for Facebook Messenger

Midnight Messenger is a different take on the standard theme that is used on Google Play Music. As much as I love the original look of Play, the brightness can hurt the eyes after a while. After noticing there wasn't a dark alternative Midnight Messenger came to be.

### Developing

Currently this extension uses a proprietary build process that I haven't open sourced yet, so it's currently not setup for easy development, unless you setup Webpack, Gulp, Grunt, etc on your own.

### About

The Chrome Extension for Midnight Messenger uses CSS generated via SASS for the different color options. These files are all self-contained in the /sass folder and should be commented somewhat to help you understand where each of the settings are.
